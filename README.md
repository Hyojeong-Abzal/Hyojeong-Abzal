### Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m a front-end developer who has a results-focused attitude to creating SPA, using React(JS/TS), Redux.
I would like to find project work and fulltime employment in a company with a modern approach to development and a collaborative team.
My free time is dedicated to Codewars, programming tutorials, and becoming familiar with NodeJS, because, in the future, I see myself as a Full Stack Developer.
